# Tic Tac Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Ruby.
It features an AI that blocks the human player from placing a winning move, and completes its own winning strategy.
It could be further abstracted, but it works.

If you want to run it in an isolated environment, there's a Dockerfile in there ready to host the game and run tests.
